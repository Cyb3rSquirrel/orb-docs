# Orb Notifications

This guide explains how to configure and customize notifications in the Orb app so you can stay informed about your network's performance and any issues that arise.

## Types of Notifications

Orb can send notifications to keep you informed about your network:

### Offline/Online Status Notifications

**Sensor Status**: Alerts about your Orb sensors going offline or coming back online

**Additional notification types and settings coming soon!**

## Notification Settings

### Accessing Notification Settings from Account Settings

1. Open the Orb app
2. Go to Settings > Notifications
3. You'll see a list of notifications available for your account

   - Allow Notifications: toggling this allows the device to receive notifications from your Orbs
   - Orb list: all Orbs linked to your account appear below, specify which Orbs you would like to reeceive notifications from.

   Note: receiving notifications from mobile devices may be too noisy as these Orbs will go online and offline frequently (when app closed or backgrounded). Exceptions include: using a spare phone as a dedicated sensor or using the "keep awake" feature.

### Accessing Notification Settings from Orb Settings Menu

1. Open the Orb app
2. Go to Orb settings menu (...)
3. Use the notification toggle to enable/disable notifications for that specific Orb

## Troubleshooting

### Not Receiving Notifications

If you're not receiving expected notifications:

1. Check that notifications are enabled in the Orb app
2. Verify your device's system notification settings for Orb
3. Ensure your device has an active internet connection
4. Check that Do Not Disturb mode isn't active
5. Try restarting the app or your device
